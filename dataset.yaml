# Quick summary:
# - Purpose: config for YOLOv8 training/validation (image paths + class names).
# - Keys:
#   - train / val: paths to training and validation image folders.
#   - nc: number of classes (must equal len(names)).
#   - names: ordered list of class names (indices map to class IDs in labels).
# - Checks: ensure train/val paths exist; each image has a matching YOLO .txt label
#   with lines: <class_id> <x_center> <y_center> <width> <height> (normalized 0..1).
# - Example training command (run from project root):
#     yolo task=detect mode=train data=dataset.yaml model=yolov8n.pt epochs=100
